This project showcases an AI-native edge assistant built using the ESP32-CAM (WiFi + BLE) microcontroller, a 2MP camera, and a 0.96" OLED (SSD1306) display. 
The system captures images, processes them locally, and sends them to OpenAI's API, which analyzes the content and generates a poem in real-time.
